Sagar is good mathematician as well as CSE student and has learned few concepts such as HCF and LCM.
Now, to test his learning , his room-mate Mohith gave him a number N and asked him to give biggest 
possible HCF that can be obtained by 3 numbers less than or equal to N (All 3 numbers need to be distinct).
