/*You have to design a new model which maps an even length palindromic number to some digit between 0 to 9.
The number is mapped to a digit x on the basis of following criteria:
1.  x should appear maximum number of times in the palindromic number, that is, among all digits in the number, x should appear maximum number of times.
2. If more than one digit appears maximum number of times, x should be the smallest digit among them.

Given an integer n, you have to find the digit x for the n even length palindromic number.

Note- First 9 even length palindromic numbers are:

            11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99
