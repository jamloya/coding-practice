/*You are given a string S.

Q number of operations are performed on string S.
In each of these Q operations, you are given an index ind and a character ch . For each operation, you have to update character at index ind in string S to ch, that is, after this operation s[ind]=ch .
It is guaranteed that any index is updated atmost once.
We call the final string after performing Q number of operations as str .

After this, M number of operations are performed on string str.
In each of these M operations, you are given two indices a and b. For each operation, you have to reverse the substring that lies between the indices a and b (inclusive). 
We call the final string after performing M operations as fin.
